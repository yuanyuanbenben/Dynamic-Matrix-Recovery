## Manuscript Part

In this dictionary, figures generated by numerical simulation and real data experiments used in the article are display here. We use those definition in following description.
> $\rho = n_t/m_1m_2,\quad \tau = 1/T, \quad \text{MSE}_t = (m_1m_2)^{-1}\|\hat{M}_t-M^0_t\|_2^2,\quad \text{AMSE} = \tau * \sum_{t=1}^T \text{MSE}_t$
where $n_t$ is the sample size, $m_1,m_2$ are the dimension of matrix and $T$ is the number of time points.

- "***baseline.png***": The comparisons of MSE for DLR and three benchmarks, which corresponds to *Figure 1* in the main context.
- "***phase_transition.png***": The $\text{MSE}_t$ of DLR estimates under different settings of sample size $n_t$ and number of time point $T$, which corresponds to *Figure 2 left* in the main context.
- "***precise_nt.png***": The relationship between the logarithm of $\text{AMSE}$ and the logarithm of $\rho/\tau$ show a linear trend with slope $-4/5$, which corresponds to *Figure 2 right* in the main context.
